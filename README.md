# ITI Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains practical assignments and mini-projects completed as part of the **ITI Machine Learning Track**. Each directory represents a standalone task or experiment exploring a specific machine learning concept, including:

- Data preprocessing
- Classification models
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Model evaluation

## Structure

Each subdirectory contains:

- Source code (`.py` or notebooks)
- A `README.md` explaining the task
- Output results and insights

## Included Projects

- `heart-disease-classification-pca`: A complete pipeline for predicting heart disease using logistic regression, SVM, and random forest, both with and without PCA for dimensionality reduction.

> More directories will be added as the program progresses.

## Requirements

Each project has its own requirements listed in its folder. Most commonly used libraries include:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates the learning journey through real-world datasets, model building, evaluation, and optimization using Python and machine learning libraries.
