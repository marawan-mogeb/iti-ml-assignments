# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore, clean, and visualize data patterns to understand factors that affected passenger survival on the Titanic.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic passenger manifest, containing features like passenger class, sex, age, fare, embarkation port, and whether the person survived.

## 🔧 Data Preprocessing Steps

- **Missing Values**:
  - `Age`: Filled with median age.
  - `Embarked`: Filled with the mode (most common port).
  - `Fare`: Filled with the mean fare.

- **Column Removal**:
  - Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns: `PassengerId`, `Ticket`, and `Cabin`.

- **Encoding and Type Conversion**:
  - Converted `Survived` from numerical (0/1) to categorical (`Died`, `Survived`).
  - Converted `Pclass` to categorical (ordinal).
  - Converted `Age` to integer for simplicity.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted honorific titles from `Name` and grouped rare titles.
  - Created `FamilySize` as a new feature: `SibSp + Parch + 1`.

## 📈 Visualizations and Insights

### ✅ Survival Count
- Majority of passengers **died (~62%)**.
- Imbalanced dataset: More non-survivors than survivors.

### ✅ Survival by Class
- **1st class** had a higher survival rate.
- **3rd class** had the lowest survival rate.

### ✅ Survival by Sex
- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

### ✅ Survival by Embarkation Port
- **Cherbourg (C)** passengers had the highest survival rate proportionally.
- **Southampton (S)** had the most passengers.

### ✅ Age Distribution
- **Children under 10** had a higher survival chance.
- Most deaths occurred between ages **20–40**.

### ✅ Fare Distribution
- Survivors generally paid **higher fares**, suggesting class/social status influenced survival.

### ✅ Survival by Title
- Titles such as **Mrs, Miss** had higher survival rates.
- Rare or aristocratic titles also showed better survival.

### ✅ Fare vs Age Scatter Plot
- Older, high-paying passengers had higher survival.
- Many young, low-fare passengers died.

### ✅ Correlation Heatmap
- `FamilySize` is strongly correlated with `SibSp` and `Parch`.
- Weak positive correlation between `Fare` and survival-related features.
